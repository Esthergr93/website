The video shows the execution of a tidy-up task with a Nao humanoid robot, which was
presented at the Humanoids 2014 conference.
The robot observes the scene at the start and then plans symbolic actions in order
to pick up all objects and transport them to their container. The robot hereby
continuously observes the environment and monitors its state to react to unforseen
changes and to perform replanning if needed.</div>
